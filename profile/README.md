## 💎 **Project Overview**

**Dentifycare** is a mobile application designed to provide dental care services to dental co-assistants and the general public. The app addresses the challenges faced by dental co-assistants in managing patient care while fulfilling their clinical requirements, and it helps reduce the financial burden on patients who struggle to access affordable dental services. Featuring AI-based preliminary diagnoses of dental conditions from patient images, the app also provides a platform for co-assistants to connect with patients, ensuring better care and faster access to services.

## 🌍 **Why It Matters**

In Indonesia, the ratio of dentists to patients is alarmingly high, with one dentist serving 12,000 patients, far exceeding the recommended 7,500 patients per dentist. This disparity creates significant barriers to dental health access and often results in high treatment costs. **Dentifycare** aims to bridge this gap by offering an easy-to-use platform that connects patients with dental co-assistants, provides free or affordable care, and accelerates the clinical practice requirements of co-assistants. By integrating AI diagnostics, the app also facilitates better patient care and early intervention.

Our solution directly aligns with Indonesia's **Health Law (RI No. 36 of 2009)**, which guarantees the right to safe, quality, and affordable healthcare for all citizens.

## 🚀 **Project Goals**

Our mission is to provide an integrated digital platform that:
- 💪 **Empowers co-assistants**: Helps dental co-assistants meet clinical requirements and connect with patients.
- 🏥 **Improves dental care accessibility**: Offers patients free or affordable dental services.
- 🤖 **Incorporates AI diagnostics**: Uses artificial intelligence to analyze patient images and support early diagnosis.

## 💡 **How Did We Come Up With This Project?**

In Indonesia, the lack of accessible dental care is a significant issue, with a disproportionate number of patients for each dentist. This often results in limited care and high costs for patients. At the same time, dental co-assistants face challenges in finding patients to meet their clinical practice requirements. **Dentifycare** was conceived as a solution to this problem. By creating a platform where co-assistants can easily connect with patients in need of dental care, we aim to improve the efficiency of dental health services, make dental care more affordable, and accelerate the education of co-assistants.

## 🚀 **Project Branches**

We have divided our project into distinct areas of focus to ensure smooth development and organization:
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Focuses on the development of AI-based image analysis algorithms to assist in preliminary diagnosis of dental conditions.
- 📱 **Mobile Android Development**: Develops a user-friendly mobile app for both dental co-assistants and patients, providing a seamless experience for connecting and receiving care.
- ☁️ **Cloud Computing**: Manages the backend and data processing needed for efficient patient-co-assistant interactions and AI diagnosis.

We’re excited to share our journey with you and contribute to making dental health care accessible for all! 🚀
